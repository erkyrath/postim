# IMAGE SHARP seamless.imp

# Generates a version of an image which tiles seamlessly.
# This is a very simple algorithm; it just tiles the center of the
# image in a diamond-shaped tesselation. The diagonal borders are
# smoothly interpolated to avoid seams. To sharpen this interpolation,
# increase the SHARP value. (Try values from 2 to 8 or so.)
